DevOps vs. Agile
========

 
 Agile

Agile is a software development strategy that focuses on responding to change with cross-functional team communication. Project management, software development, and incident management all require the ability to adapt to situations as they arise. The Agile strategy allows for the highly efficient day-to-day management of complex issues between teams and customers.
Agile and DevOps both aim to deliver highly functional software in a timely manner. The difference between the two is that agile focuses on optimizing the development life cycle, while DevOps unites development and operations in a CI/CD environment. When used together, they work hand-in-hand to improve software development, decrease lead times and resolution times, and ensure an overall more efficient organization.
